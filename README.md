# FAMCalendar

FAMCalendar is an application that allows people to use several facets of the Fertility Awareness Method at once. Specifically: 

* Temperature method 
* Cervical mucus method 

When combined, these methods are called the symptothermal method, and is a more affective means of birth control than each method on its own. These methods are effective for people with irregular cycles.
